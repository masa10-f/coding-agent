# Antipatterns Skill

## Overview

This skill contains a collection of coding antipatterns that agents should avoid. Each antipattern is documented in the `patterns/` directory and should be consulted during code review and implementation tasks.

**When this skill applies:**
- Code review tasks
- Writing new code
- Refactoring existing code
- Any implementation work

## How to Use

When performing code review or implementation:

1. Review all pattern files in `patterns/` directory
2. Check if the code being written or reviewed violates any antipattern
3. If a violation is found, fix it according to the guidance provided

## Current Antipatterns

The following antipatterns are currently documented:

| ID | Pattern | Category |
|----|---------|----------|
| AP-001 | Avoid `object` type in Python | Python/Typing |
| AP-002 | Don't modify pyproject.toml unnecessarily | Configuration |
| AP-003 | Use collections.abc for generic types | Python/Typing |
| AP-004 | Reuse existing enums | Code Reuse |
| AP-005 | Always add unit tests for new features | Testing |

## Adding New Antipatterns

To add a new antipattern:

1. Create a new markdown file in `patterns/` directory
2. Follow the naming convention: `AP-XXX-short-description.md`
3. Use the template structure:
   ```markdown
   # AP-XXX: Title

   ## Category
   [Category name]

   ## Description
   [What the antipattern is]

   ## Why It's Bad
   [Why this should be avoided]

   ## Correct Approach
   [How to do it correctly]

   ## Examples

   ### Bad
   [Code example of the antipattern]

   ### Good
   [Code example of the correct approach]
   ```

4. Update this SKILL.md to include the new antipattern in the table above

## Pattern Files

All antipattern definitions are stored in:
- `patterns/AP-001-avoid-object-type.md`
- `patterns/AP-002-no-pyproject-modification.md`
- `patterns/AP-003-use-collections-abc.md`
- `patterns/AP-004-reuse-enums.md`
- `patterns/AP-005-add-unit-tests.md`
