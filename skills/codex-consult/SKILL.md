# Codex Consult

## Overview

This skill enables consultation with OpenAI's Codex CLI for deeper implementation analysis. Codex uses more powerful reasoning models (gpt-5.2-codex) that can provide thorough architectural guidance and implementation plans.

**When to use:**
- Complex architectural decisions requiring deep analysis
- Implementation planning for multi-file changes
- Code review needing extended reasoning
- Design pattern recommendations
- Refactoring strategy development

## Execution Modes

### Plan Mode (Default)
Provides analysis and implementation planning without code changes.

Output includes:
1. Summary of the approach
2. Implementation strategy
3. Verification steps

### Patch Mode
Provides analysis with concrete code change suggestions in unified diff format.

Output includes:
1. Summary of proposed changes
2. Unified diff patches
3. Verification steps

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Task description | Required. What to analyze or plan | - |
| `--model=<model>` | Model to use | gpt-5.2-codex |
| `--mode=plan\|patch` | Execution mode | plan |
| `--scope=<path>` | Target directory | current repo root |
| `--no-web` | Disable web search | web enabled by default |

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Consultation (Plan Mode)

To consult Codex for implementation planning:

1. Execute the wrapper script with task description:
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-exec.sh "Implement user authentication with JWT"
   ```

2. Read the output from `/tmp/codex-consult.last.md`

3. If output is empty or error occurs, check `/tmp/codex-consult.run.log`

### Patch Mode Consultation

To get concrete code change suggestions:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-exec.sh --mode=patch "Refactor the database connection to use connection pooling"
```

### Custom Model

To use a different model:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-exec.sh --model=o4-mini "Design the caching layer"
```

### Scoped Analysis

To analyze a specific directory:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-exec.sh --scope=/path/to/src "Review error handling patterns"
```

### Disable Web Search

To run without web search:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-exec.sh --no-web "Analyze this legacy code"
```

## Output Interpretation

### Summary Section
- What changes are proposed
- Assumptions and preconditions
- Impact analysis

### Changes Section (Patch Mode)
- Unified diff format
- File-by-file breakdown
- Explanation of each change

### Verification Section
- Test commands to run
- Manual verification steps
- Edge cases to check

## Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Provide clear task descriptions with context
2. **Scope appropriately**: Use `--scope` to limit analysis to relevant code
3. **Start with plan mode**: Use plan mode first, then patch mode if needed
4. **Verify suggestions**: Always review Codex output before applying changes

## Error Handling

If Codex execution fails:
1. Check `/tmp/codex-consult.run.log` for error details
2. Verify Codex CLI is authenticated (`codex login`)
3. Check network connectivity
4. Try with a different model if quota exceeded
